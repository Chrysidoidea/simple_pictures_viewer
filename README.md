# Test Gallery - React Portfolio Project
This simple React app demonstrates my skills as a React front-end developer. The app displays a gallery of animal pictures that users can click on to view in a modal window with a blurred background. The project uses `styled-components` for CSS-in-JS and responsive design.

## Features
- Responsive gallery grid layout
- Clickable images that open in a modal window
- Blurred background when the modal is open
- Custom close button in the modal window
